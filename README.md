This is the Github repo for the cap2 machine learning scripts. It has 3 python scripts. 
1: A script for an xgboost based classifier
2: A script for a bagging boosting classifier
3: A script for a random forest
To run the scripts you need to install the python packages in the requierements.txt file.
If you run the scripts it will create a excel file with the cv results and a txt file that stores the best classifier.
